### Hello fellow earthlings

I'm Joshua Freedman, a Sr. Software Engineer living in the Dallas, TX area.

My preferred programming languages are Kotlin/Java, but will work in any as needed.

I spend way to much of my spare time at the Dallas Makerspace, if you are ever in the area, come say Hi!

Random hobbies/projects:
- 📻 Radio stuff. I am amateur licensed, only technician class for now although I plan on upgrading _sometime_ soon.
- 🔌 Learning electronics. I've been slowly diving into the embedded software dev world as well as 80s/90s era hardware programming. VMEbus and the like have been the never ending learning curve lately.
- 🚴‍♂️ Biking... Although I haven't had much opportuinity to do so recently due to the heat out here 🌞
- 📫 AX.25/APRS fun. Latest project has been writing an AX.25 demodulator, APRS decoder/processor, and IGate/Digipeater system in Kotlin. As of July 9th 2023, its working in a beta state! If anyone wants to try it out let me know.
